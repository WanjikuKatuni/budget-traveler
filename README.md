# MAPENI TRAVELS

Just like the name suggests, Mapeni Travels is an application where people who do not have enough money to travel can get recommendations of the ebst travel destinations with the best prices since people post and share the budgets they used and the total cost. This makes it easier for the user to see the applicability of the trip with the mapeni he, they or she has.
